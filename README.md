# Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp - Homework 15: Clicky Game
This homework is a game which tests the player's memory with a Super Mario Brothers theme. Twelve cards are displayed to the player. The goal is to click all twelve cards without clicking the same card twice. After each click, the cards are randomly shuffled to test the player's memory. A message is displayed to the player if he/she makes a successful click, loses the game, or wins the game. His/her score is also tracked along with the high score. If the player wins the game, the high score is reset.

If the player clicks the same card twice, then the game is over. The player wins the game when he/she has clicked all twelve cards without clicking a card twice (score reaches 12).
